# INTRODUCTION: 

## how websites are created? 
- all websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.

## how the web works?
 - when you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. in order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System server.

#### HTML describes the structure of pages. ## summary:
- HTML pages are text documents. 
- HTML uses tags to give the information they surround special meaning. 
- tags are often referred to as elements.
- tags usually come in pairs.
- opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element. 
- attributes require a name and a value.

## summary of the forms: 
- whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a <form> element.
- information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
- each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server. 
- HTML5 introduces new form elements which make it easier for visitors to fill in forms. 

### contrast of background images:
- high contrast
- low contrast
- screen

## summary of images:
- we can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. 
- images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
- we can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page. 
- background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
- we can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
- to reduce the number of images your browser has to load, we can create image sprites.
# new HTML5 layout elements:

- HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. the names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them.

## summary of HTML5 layout:
- the new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of a web page and help to describe its structure. 
- the new elements provide clearer code. 
- older browsers that don't understand HTML5 elements need to be told which elements are block-level elements. 
- to make HTML5 elements work in internet explorer 8, which JavaScript is needed, which is available free from google.

# who is the site for?
- every website should be designed for the target audience-not just for yourself or the site owner. it is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
